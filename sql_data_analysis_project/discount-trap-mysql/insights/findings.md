📌 Project: Discount Trap — Revenue Growth but Profit Decline

1. Objective

The objective of this analysis was to identify products that show revenue growth over time but suffer from declining profit margins due to excessive discounting. Such products appear successful in sales reports but silently damage profitability.


2. Methodology

*Aggregated transactional data at product–month level

*Allocated order-level discounts proportionally to products

*Split timeline into Early vs Recent periods

*Compared:

    Revenue Growth (%)

    Margin Change (%)

*Flagged products where:

    Revenue increased

    Margin declined


3. Key Findings

*Several products showed positive revenue growth but negative margin change

*These products relied heavily on discounts to drive sales

*Revenue-focused metrics alone would incorrectly classify these products as “top performers”


4. Discount Trap Products

Products classified as Discount Traps met the following criteria:

*Revenue Growth > 0

*Margin Change < 0

These products represent high commercial risk despite growing sales.


5. Business Interpretation
Revenue growth driven by discounting is not sustainable.
While discounts increase short-term demand, they erode long-term profitability and distort true product performance.


6. Recommendations

*Review discount strategies for identified discount trap products

*Introduce margin-based KPIs alongside revenue metrics

*Test price elasticity before applying blanket discounts

*Prioritize products with healthy growth and stable margins


7. Business Value

This analysis helps pricing and category teams:

    *Detect hidden profit leakage

    *Improve pricing discipline

    *Make data-driven discount decisions
