# 📌 Key Findings & Insights

## 1️⃣ League Performance vs True Strength
League points alone do not fully explain team performance.  
The weighted performance model reveals differences between **results-based ranking** and **performance-based ranking**, highlighting overperforming and underperforming teams.

---

## 2️⃣ Metric Impact on Points
Correlation analysis shows:

- **Wins and Goal Difference** have the strongest impact on league points
- **Goals Against** has a strong negative correlation with points
- **Goals For** contributes positively but is less influential than goal difference

This confirms that **defensive stability and match outcomes** matter more than scoring alone.

---

## 3️⃣ Normalized Performance Comparison
Metric normalization allows fair comparison across teams by placing all metrics on a common scale (0–1).

- Top teams show consistently high normalized values across metrics
- Bottom-ranked teams show weakness across multiple performance dimensions
- Balanced teams outperform those relying on a single strength

---

## 4️⃣ Performance Score Model Insights
The weighted performance score successfully identifies:
- Title contenders with high consistency
- Mid-table teams with balanced profiles
- Relegation-zone teams with poor overall metrics

The model ranking closely aligns with the league table while also highlighting ranking deviations.

---

## 5️⃣ Actual Rank vs Model Rank
Comparing actual league rank with model rank reveals:
- Teams outperforming expectations due to efficiency
- Teams underperforming despite strong underlying metrics
- Model accuracy in capturing overall season trends

---

## 6️⃣ Home vs Away Dependency
Home vs away analysis indicates:
- Some teams rely heavily on home advantage
- Strong teams maintain consistent performance both home and away
- Away performance is a key differentiator among top teams

---

## 7️⃣ Strategic Takeaways
- Balanced performance across attack, defense, and results leads to higher success
- Over-reliance on home matches can limit overall league success
- Analytical models provide deeper insights than traditional tables

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how structured data analysis and modeling can uncover deeper insights in sports analytics.  
The approach mirrors real-world analytical workflows used in professional sports and business intelligence environments.
