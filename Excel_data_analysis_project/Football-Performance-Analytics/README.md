# ⚽ Football Performance Analytics – Premier League

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Premier League team performance using match-level data and advanced analytical techniques.  
Instead of relying only on league points, a **custom performance model** is built using normalized and weighted metrics to evaluate true team strength.

The project is implemented fully in **Microsoft Excel**, following a structured, multi-phase analytical workflow similar to real-world sports analytics projects.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze team performance beyond league points
- Identify which metrics most strongly influence points
- Build a **weighted performance score model**
- Compare **actual league rank vs model-based rank**
- Analyze **home vs away dependency**
- Present insights through a professional dashboard
