📌 Project Objective

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate hospital operational efficiency, patient flow, and capacity utilization using synthetic healthcare data.
The dashboard focuses on identifying wait-time bottlenecks, bed utilization risks, and overall system efficiency to support hospital management decision-making.

📊 Key Findings & Insights
1️⃣ Patient Volume & Flow

* The hospital handled ~204K total patients, averaging ~279 patients per day.

* Admissions and discharges are closely aligned, resulting in a throughput rate of ~0.80, indicating a relatively stable patient flow.

* Minor imbalances in admissions vs discharges can still create short-term congestion during peak periods.

📌 Insight:
Operational flow is stable, but surges in daily arrivals can quickly impact wait times.


2️⃣ Wait Time Analysis

* The average patient wait time is ~40.8 minutes, with a 7-day rolling average of ~39.5 minutes.

* Rolling averages show temporary spikes, suggesting short-term operational stress rather than persistent inefficiency.

* Departments with higher patient inflow contribute disproportionately to increased wait times.

📌 Insight:
Wait times are mostly controlled, but staff allocation and triage optimization during peak days can reduce spikes.


3️⃣ Bed Occupancy & Capacity Utilization

* Average bed occupancy is ~81%, with ~27 beds occupied on average.

* This level is within acceptable limits but approaches the risk threshold commonly considered at 85%+ occupancy.

* The High Occupancy Flag remains mostly inactive, indicating limited periods of critical overcrowding.

📌 Insight:
The hospital operates efficiently, but capacity buffers are limited during demand surges.


4️⃣ Emergency Room (ER) Risk Monitoring

* The ER Overload Index remains mostly stable, suggesting no sustained overload conditions.

* Overload risk appears only during short peak intervals rather than across long durations.

📌 Insight:
Current ER capacity is adequate, but early warning indicators should be monitored proactively.



5️⃣ Staffing & Operational Efficiency

* The staff-to-patient ratio (~0.29) supports current demand levels.

* The overall efficiency score of ~0.82 reflects strong operational performance.

* Higher efficiency correlates with lower wait times and balanced patient flow.

📌 Insight:
Staffing levels are generally appropriate, but dynamic staffing during peak hours could further improve efficiency.

🚨 Risk & Opportunity Summary
Area	                Status	                Interpretation
Patient Flow	      🟢 Stable                	Admissions & discharges balanced
Wait Time	          🟡 Moderate	            Short-term spikes observed
Bed Occupancy	      🟡 Watch	                Near risk threshold
ER Load	              🟢 Controlled	            No sustained overload
Efficiency	          🟢 Strong	                Effective resource utilization


📈 Recommendations

1. Implement peak-hour staffing adjustments to reduce wait time spikes.

2. Monitor bed occupancy thresholds (>85%) to avoid sudden capacity stress.

3. Use rolling wait-time trends as early indicators of operational strain.

4. Adopt predictive staffing models based on historical patient arrival patterns.


✅ Conclusion

The hospital demonstrates strong operational efficiency with controlled risk levels.
However, proactive capacity and staffing management is essential to sustain performance during periods of elevated patient demand.
