# Key Findings — Car Insurance Price Sensitivity & Discount Analytics

## 1. Discount Impact on Pricing
- Statistical testing confirms that discounts have a **significant impact on pricing outcomes**.
- Policies with discounts show materially different premium deviations compared to non-discounted policies.
- The hypothesis test (two-sample t-test) rejects the null hypothesis at a 95% confidence level.

## 2. Price Sensitivity Segmentation
Policies were segmented into four pricing zones:
- Highly Discounted
- Competitive
- Market Priced
- Overpriced

Most policies fall within the **Competitive and Market Priced zones**, indicating reasonable alignment with market pricing.

## 3. Profitability vs Discount Trade-off
- Average underwriting margins **decrease as discount levels increase**.
- Highly discounted policies consistently show the **lowest margins**.
- Overpriced policies deliver higher margins but risk lower competitiveness.

## 4. Risk Concentration
- Loss-making policies are disproportionately concentrated in **Highly Discounted and Competitive segments**.
- This confirms that pricing strategy is a key driver of underwriting risk.

## 5. Optimal Pricing Zone
- The **Competitive pricing zone** delivers the best balance between:
  - Policy volume
  - Profitability
  - Risk control

## 6. Business Implication
- Excessive discounting improves short-term acquisition but weakens long-term profitability.
- Pricing discipline and controlled discounting are essential for sustainable growth.

### Executive Conclusion
Discounts should be applied selectively using risk-based rules. The Competitive pricing zone should be protected and scaled to maximize profitability without increasing loss exposure.
