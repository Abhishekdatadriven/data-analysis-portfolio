# 🎬 Content Engagement, Churn & Monetization Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes user behavior in a digital content platform (Media / Entertainment / OTT) to understand:
- User engagement patterns
- Churn behavior
- Subscription-based monetization
- Executive-level KPIs and visual storytelling

The project is structured end-to-end like a real industry analytics workflow.

---

## 🧠 Business Questions
- What drives user churn?
- Do engagement metrics differ between churned and active users?
- Which subscription plan generates the most revenue?
- Can we proactively identify high-risk churn users?
